The project is broadly divided into two parts:
* My Project -- The unity project for simulating Mars terrains and generating synthetic data
* training-and-testing -- It takes the synthetic data to train a model, and tests it on real **AI4Mars** dataset.

Each have separate `readme.md` files which explain how to setup and use; there is synthetic data already generated, but it is a small subset. This can just be used as it is, in which case, one can focus on the `training-and-testing` part. However, it is possible and steps have been explained on how to regenerate the synthetic data. This will be in the `readme.md` of the `My Project` folder.
